# Documentation

Start with the [roadmap](ROADMAP.md). The research behind it is in [`../Research/`](../Research/README.md).

Most of the design notes below come from the Bloodborne port (bbport) that this project grew
out of. The engine code they describe (loader, runtime, renderer, upscalers) is the same one
that runs Uncharted. They were written in Russian and translated on 2026-10-16. The originals
are in [`ru/`](ru/), at the same paths.

## Building

- [BUILDING_LINUX.md](BUILDING_LINUX.md): building and running on Linux from source, with every dependency's minimum and tested version.

## Plans

- [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md): goals, phases and open items (Uncharted on Linux, on spacepepperoni's fork).
- [history/BLOODBORNE_ROADMAP_2026-09-30.md](history/BLOODBORNE_ROADMAP_2026-09-30.md): the
  Bloodborne-era plan, with the state of the renderer and upscaler at the end of September.
