# Overview map: how this tree runs Uncharted

*Written by Claude on 2026-10-17 from reading the code on `linux`, updated the same day after merging spacepepperoni's Linux fork (c06843d, which carries SuperMedo's 0.3.6). Nothing here was run on our machines. Each claim is "read", not "measured". Module maps for the parts below are the roadmap's first goal; this page is the index they hang off.*

## The idea in one paragraph

This is not an emulator. The game's own x86-64 code (from the PS4 executables in the player's dump) runs natively on the PC. A small runtime written in C replaces the PS4 system libraries the game calls, and the game's GPU command stream is translated to Vulkan by a renderer taken from shadPS4 and extended. The tree is SuperMedo's Uncharted port of **bbport**, deadinside28's native Linux port of Bloodborne, so most of the code, the comments and many docs still say Bloodborne (`bb`, `bbport`, `BB_*`). The Linux launcher, packaging and the Linux game fixes come from spacepepperoni's fork (`spacepepperoni/uncharted_Linux`), which our `linux` branch now builds on.

## The pieces

| Piece | Where | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| Executable preparation | `scripts/prepare.py`, `scripts/link_modules.py`, `scripts/link_libc.py`, `scripts/patches.py`, `scripts/mods.py` | Python, run offline on the player's dump. `prepare.py` inspects an already-plaintext PS4 SELF (no decryption) and turns it into a flat memory image plus metadata. `link_modules.py` (the successor of `link_libc.py`, which it still imports for `encode_id`) links the PS4's own libc.prx and other modules in as native code. `patches.py` applies game patches (`patches/`); `mods.py` handles mods (`docs/MODS.md`). |
| Loader | `src/probe.c` (1,165 lines) | The process that maps the prepared image (segments, relocations), resolves the game's imports to the runtime, and jumps to the entry point. Builds as `out/bb-probe` (Linux) or `out/bb-probe.exe` (Windows). Its first line calls itself a "minimal x86-64 native loader experiment". |
| Import table | `src/import_names.inc` (933 lines) | The PS4 library functions the runtime knows by name. |
| PS4 runtime (the replaced system libraries) | `src/runtime*.c`, `src/runtime.h` | One file per area: `runtime_memory` (866), `runtime_pad` (874, controllers), `runtime_services` (697; also the "load another executable" exit, code 101), `runtime_ajm` (707, audio decode: ATRAC9 via LibAtrac9, MP3 via libavcodec), `runtime_file` (557), `runtime_thread` (465), `runtime_savedata` (418), `runtime_fiber` (362), `runtime_kernel` (351), `runtime_audio` (305), plus `runtime_content`, mutex, rwlock, sema, time, rtc. `src/compat_win.c`/`.h` hold Windows shims; `src/vulkan_smoke.c` is linked into the loader too. |
| GPU library | `gpu/` → `libbbgpu.so` (Linux) or linked into the exe (Windows) | `gpu/shadps4/` is a vendored part of shadPS4 (commit b4e7ae7, see `gpu/VENDOR.txt`): `video_core` (Vulkan renderer), `shader_recompiler` (PS4 GCN shaders to SPIR-V), `common`, plus the gnmdriver/videoout libraries and Videodec2 for cutscenes. Local changes are marked `bbport:`. `gpu/shim/` is this project's glue: `bbgpu.cpp` (the C entry points `src/` calls, header `gpu/bbgpu.h`), `window.cpp`/`sdl_window.h` (SDL3 window), `bbport_overlay`, `bbport_settings`, `bbport_threads.h`, `bbport_copy`, `bb_win_compat.h`. `gpu/third_party/` is vendored libraries (sirit, half, imgui, FSR-Vulkan, xbyak and others). |
| Upscalers | `gpu/third_party/fsr-vulkan`, `gpu/patches/fsr-vulkan`, `tools/fsr4cap/` | FSR 3.1, FSR 4 and 4.1.1 (assets built on the player's machine from their own DLLs), DLSS on Windows through `tools/bridge_helper/`. Design notes: `docs/upscaler.md`, `docs/motion_vectors.md`, `docs/DEPTH_ADAPTIVE_TAA.md`. |
| Launchers | `run.py` (250 lines), `launcher/`, `run.sh` (125) | `run.py` starts the loader, picks the game, prepares it, and relaunches when the collection menu asks for another game (exit code 101). It now runs on both systems (`WINDOWS = sys.platform == 'win32'`; the `ctypes.windll` calls are Windows-only branches). `launcher/uncharted_linux.py` (1,280 lines, spacepepperoni) is the Linux GUI launcher: game choice, per-game Add to Steam, Steam Deck mode, Saves per game, update check, crash reports. `launcher/uncharted_launcher.py` (1,773 lines) is the Windows GUI launcher. `run.sh` is still the old Bloodborne launcher (default folder `../CUSA03173`); `bbport_launcher*.py` are Bloodborne's. |
| Build | `build.sh`, `gpu/CMakeLists.txt`, `shell.nix`, `msys2-env.sh` | `build.sh` branches on `uname -s`: MSYS2/MinGW builds everything with CMake + Ninja + clang; otherwise it needs pkg-config with vulkan and sdl3, cmake and ninja, builds `libbbgpu.so` with CMake, builds LibAtrac9, then compiles `src/probe.c` with the runtime files directly with `$CC` (`-Werror`). On Linux it also links libavcodec/libavutil for the MP3 decoder. `bash build.sh --test` (Linux branch only) also builds and runs `tests/test_pad.c`, `test_runtime.c`, `test_file_mods.c`, `test_sema.c` and `test_content.c`. |
| Tests | `tests/` | The C tests above, `test_patches.py`, and GPU-side C++ tests (`test_taa_shader.cpp`, `test_scene_resolution.cpp`). |
| Packaging | `packaging/`, `install.sh`, `.github/workflows/` | `packaging/linux/package.sh` (spacepepperoni: `dist/uncharted-linux.tar.gz` with the PyInstaller-frozen launcher, `bin/bb-probe`, `libbbgpu.so` and the libraries a Deck may lack), the AppImage (self-updating), `install.sh` (puts the AppImage in `~/Applications` with a menu entry), `packaging/windows/package.sh` (SuperMedo's zip), `packaging/appimage.sh` (inherited from bbport). The workflows `build.yml` (release on push to `main`) and `sync-upstream.yml` (every 6 h, force-pushes `upstream` and merges into `main`) run only from the default branch, so they are inert on our `linux`. |

## How a game starts (read from the code)

1. The launcher (`run.py`, or the GUI) points at the player's dump and runs `prepare.py` then `link_modules.py` for the chosen executable (`run.py` `prepare()`, line 65).
2. It starts `bb-probe`, which maps the prepared image, binds imports to `src/runtime*.c`, and starts the game's code natively.
3. The game's GPU calls (gnmdriver, videoout) go through `gpu/shim/bbgpu.cpp` into shadPS4's `video_core`, which records Vulkan.
4. When the collection menu picks Uncharted 1, 2 or 3, the runtime exits with code 101 (`runtime_services.c`) and the launcher starts the chosen executable.

## Where Linux and Windows differ

Files with `_WIN32` / `windows.h` branches, by count (read with grep, 2026-10-17, after the merge): `src/probe.c` 23, `src/runtime_file.c` 12, `runtime_thread.c` 7, `runtime_memory.c` 7, `runtime_kernel.c` 7, `runtime_fiber.c` 5, `gpu/shim/common/slot_vector_pages.cpp` 5, `runtime_services.c` 3, `gpu/shim/bbport_write_log.cpp` 3, `gpu/shim/bbport_threads.h` 3, `runtime_savedata.c` 2, `compat_win.c` 2, `gpu/shim/window.cpp` 2, `gpu/shim/bb_win_compat.h` 2, `gpu/shim/bbgpu.cpp` 2, and one each in `runtime_time`, `runtime_sema`, `runtime_rtc`, `runtime_pad`, `runtime_audio`, `runtime.h`, `runtime.c`, `compat_win.h`, `gpu/shim/bbport_toggles.h`, `gpu/shim/bbport_overlay.cpp`. These are the seams where Linux and Windows differ. spacepepperoni reports the Linux branches running on the Steam Deck; we have not measured them on our machines. `runtime_fiber.c`'s Linux stack-bounds handling is a deliberate no-op: test it first.

## What to ignore when mapping

- `gpu/shadps4/` and `gpu/third_party/` are vendored (688 of the 918 files). Map them only as "what this project changed", by searching for `bbport:` comments, not file by file.
- `launcher/covers/`, `launcher/fonts/`, icons: assets.
- `launcher/bbport_*`, `docs/history/`, much of `docs/` (largely Russian): inherited from Bloodborne. Mark any claim from them "inherited from Bloodborne, not verified for Uncharted".

## Module maps to write (the roadmap's first goal)

Each in `docs/maps/<name>.md`, listing files, entry points, how they connect, and gotchas, with every claim checked against the code:

1. `loader.md`: `src/probe.c`, `src/import_names.inc`, `src/runtime.c`/`runtime.h`.
2. `prepare.md`: `scripts/prepare.py`, `link_modules.py`, `link_libc.py`, `patches.py`, `mods.py`, and what lands in the prepared folder.
3. `runtime-os.md`: memory, file, thread, fiber, kernel, mutex, rwlock, sema, time, rtc (the OS-facing half; the Linux seams).
4. `runtime-game.md`: services (exit 101), savedata, content, pad, audio, ajm.
5. `gpu-shim.md`: `gpu/shim/` and every `bbport:` change inside `gpu/shadps4/`.
6. `launch-and-build.md`: `run.py`, `launcher/uncharted_linux.py`, `build.sh`, `gpu/CMakeLists.txt`, `packaging/linux/`, `install.sh`, the workflows, and the update check.
