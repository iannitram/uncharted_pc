👾Join the Discord: https://discord.gg/X2YhSJg6R2

**Uncharted 1, 2 and 3 from the PS4 collection running natively on Linux, forked by spacepepperoni from [SuperMedo](https://github.com/Supermedo).**

**This client is a launcher that allows you to directly launch Uncharted 1-3, add to your desktop or add to your Steam Library. This fork features auto-updates, a modified save system and a Steam Deck mode that optimizes playback for Steam Deck.**

- If opening the launcher itself, you'll see available updates in the bottom left of the launcher.

## Steam Deck

- For Steam Deck, it is recommended to install the [.AppImage](https://github.com/spacepepperoni/uncharted_Linux/releases/latest/download/Uncharted-x86_64.AppImage) and add the games to Steam to play in Game Mode. 
- In the Display tab, a Steam Deck mode is auto-selected if you are on SteamOS. With this enabled, expect an average of 25-30fps with occasional dips during demanding segments.
- The Steam Deck runs at 60 FPS by default; 30 FPS can be picked in the launcher.
- It is recommended to set your FPS cap to 30fps and set Manual GPU Clock to 1300mhz.

## Files needed 

You must have an unencrypted extracted dump of the Uncharted: The Nathan Drake Collection (CUSA02320) v1.00.

Point the launcher to this folder in the Game tab. By default, a new Saves folder will appear within your Game folder.

Once your game folder has been specified: Play, Add to Steam (recommended for Steam Deck) or create a Desktop shortcut.

> **No game files are included.** You need your own decrypted dump of the collection
> (CUSA02343, CUSA02320, ...: the folder with eboot.bin, big2-ps4_Shipping.elf,
> big3-ps4_Shipping.elf, sce_sys, u1data, u2data and u3data).

## Features

- All three games from one launcher: Drake's Fortune, Among Thieves and Drake's Deception.
- 60 FPS like on PS4, or 120 FPS (higher rates are experimental).
- Render resolution above 1080p (up to 3200x1800) and ultrawide aspect ratios: the games draw a real larger or wider picture, set in the launcher.
- Anti-aliasing with TAA, AMD FSR 3.1, AMD FSR 4 or NVIDIA DLSS (DLAA).
- Frame generation: AMD FSR 3 (any GPU) or NVIDIA DLSS (RTX 40 2x, RTX 50 up to 4x).
- Keyboard, mouse and controller together, all remappable. Mouse look in U3.
- Stereo, 5.1 or 7.1 sound: the games are told the real speaker layout (it follows the output device, or pick it in the launcher).
- Trophies: the games' own trophy lists in the launcher, and a notice in the game when you earn one.
- Button prompts for keyboard and mouse, Xbox or PlayStation controllers; controller vibration settings.
- Cheats page (infinite health and ammo per game), launcher languages, your own covers and Steam art.
- A Fixes page for fixes that cost speed: Automatic turns each one on only where it helps.
- Add to Steam and desktop shortcuts from the launcher, automatic updates.

## System Requirements
- 64-bit x86 Linux with glibc 2.41 or newer: SteamOS 3.7+, Debian 13, Ubuntu 25.04, Fedora 42,
  Arch, or anything newer.
- A graphics card with Vulkan 1.3 with 6 GB of video memory or more.
  4 GB cards (GTX 1650, RX 570) run out of video memory and crash after a while; on those, keep
  Anti-aliasing and Frame generation off.
- About 8 GB of free RAM

## Reporting a bug
- Open the launcher, go to **Advanced** and click **Copy log for GitHub** (Steam Deck: in Desktop Mode). It copies your system details and the last game log, without your home folder or user name.
- Open a new issue in the [Issues tab](https://github.com/spacepepperoni/uncharted_Linux/issues/new?template=bug_report.yml), choose **Bug report**, and paste the log into the **Log** field.
- Say which game and where in it the problem happened.
